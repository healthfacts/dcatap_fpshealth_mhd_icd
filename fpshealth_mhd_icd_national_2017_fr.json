    "description": "This data provides more information about the diseases for which patients are admitted to hospital. The patients are classified based on the ICD (originally version 9, now version 10). ICD is an international classification system that allows the coding of clinical diagnoses. This is a classification primarily intended for the coding and registration of clinical diagnoses within a hospital setting. The number of hospital stays is shown per ICD code, which was registered as the main diagnosis for a hospital stay.",
